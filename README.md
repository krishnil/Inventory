# Inventory Program

This is an inventory program I created for my Software class. It serves as an inventory system for a small manufacturing organization. The program caters for inventory additions, modifications, and deletions. A GUI Mock-Up and a class diagram was provided for this project.

## Summary
I created a JavaFX application with a GUI based on a given Mock-up using SceneBuilder and then wrote code to display each screen. The Program has a main screen with buttons to add, modify, delete, search for parts and products, and 'Exit'. The main screen also has a list displaying the parts and products with text boxes for searching those items. The buttons redirects the users to the respective screens: 'Add Part', 'Modify Part', 'Add Product', or 'Modify Product'. I also implemented exception controls with custom error messages for logical errors, and confirm dialogue boxes for 'Delete' and 'Cancel' buttons.

## Concepts Learned
  * Designing software solutions with appropriate classes, objects, methods, and interfaces.
  * Implementing object-oriented design principles (inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction) in developing applications.
  * Producing applications using Java programming language constructs.
  * Incorporating simple exception handling in application development for improving user experience and application stability.
  * Developing user interfaces.
